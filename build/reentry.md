# Reentry Attack Tutorial 

Building a exmaple for Reentry Attack in Gno is  a great way to learn the block chain smart contract programming. 

The example here is not to show you how to write attacking contract. The purpose is explain how reentry could happen and prevent.
There are muliple ways to prevent renentries. After I deep dive in the code and understand how it happend, I feel using coding patterns and pre build libaries to prevent it are not ideal. We will explain it while we build the example.
